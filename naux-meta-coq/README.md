# NAUX Rocq model

This directory contains the separately checked formal model for NAUX semantic
claims. The tracked authority is deliberately small:

- `*.v` — proof source;
- `_CoqProject` — module/build configuration;
- `Makefile` — reproducible local entry point.

Compiled Coq products (`*.vo`, `*.glob`, auxiliary caches, and related files)
are generated locally and must not be committed.

`RegisterResidency.v` proves a bounded compiler theorem: starting from one
ordinary machine state, a selected stack slot may become resident through an
entry load or an initializing first store, be updated by an admitted
instruction trace or a bounded repetition of one admitted loop body, and be
spilled back. The resulting stack and every
non-reserved register agree with the baseline execution. A reflected Boolean
checker rejects complete plans that clobber or self-source the reserved
register before they reach the semantic transform. The model deliberately does
not claim an x86-64, allocator, aliasing, call, trap, arbitrary-CFG, plan-parser,
or whole-language proof.

```bash
make -C naux-meta-coq
rocq check -silent -o -Q naux-meta-coq NauxCore \
  NauxCore.NauxCore NauxCore.Soundness NauxCore.RegisterResidency
make -C naux-meta-coq clean
```

The checked baseline is Rocq 9.1. CI rebuilds every proof, replays the generated
objects in the kernel, and requires the reported axiom set to remain empty.
